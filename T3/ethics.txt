The relevant socially good outcomes for workers are a stable living, health insurance, ability to
get ahead in life, social security.


In this assignment, we are asked to evaluate the ethical issues in fair hiring practices within
companies that may use algorithms to predict which employee attributes will result in desired
outcomes. Possible relevant social good outcomes that were discussed in class include profit for the
company and equality in employment opportunities for people of different races. In this essay, I
will focus on the reason why socially good outcomes for the employees are a good fairness criteria.
In addition, I will show that the two "categories" of outcomes are in fact interlinked -- what is
good for employees is good for companies.

Good outcomes for the labor market include reducing unemployment and increasing wages
(relative to living cost), ideally bringing equal outcomes to the table, but if not at least trying
to ensure equal access to opportunities. With job stability and a stable health insurance, people
are able to further themselves and their families in social and economic situations. Good outcomes
for the company include being able to continue to exist and being able to profit and grow the
company, ideally by producing value to society, as well as being able to contribute to the
advancement of society. For instance, we are all beneficiaries of companies competing to provide
smartphones, and the companies make money by exploiting a desire we didn't know we had -- to be
constantly connected.

How are these two interlinked? Focusing specifically on race, we may observe that companies tend to have a specific target audience, and larger companies can in fact target more and more niches within a specific target
audience. Thus we can say that, if we had more employees of different races, we would be able to
expand the target market of the company. This would allow a company increase the
size of the "potentential market".  Concretely, say that previously we had a clothing line that was
generic for all races, but not as desirable to either. Now say that we have a clothing line that flatters
pale skin, and one that flatters brown or black skin. In doing so, we can tailor our clothing lines
more (optimistically, we might give differnt sizes and cuts of clothing depending on average
characterics such as height, or, skeptically, simply charge more for superficial changes). By hiring
employees who are able to help with these decisions and expanding this business, we have not only
improved outcomes for racial outcomes at large in society, but also improved outcomes for the
company. Companies that are able to thrive are also able to provide benefits to their employees,
such as a stable job situation, good health benefits, and other forms of stability.

Thus, the situation is much more complex at the company level than simply "hiring the employees with
features, such as race, that correlate with increased sales". In doing so we may miss out on an
extremely profitable opportunity to expand to new markets. I also value the idea of having
more of a feedback mechanism instead, where the model also depends on -- not a quota per se, but on
a "minimum standards" in terms of equality in several dimensions, perhaps race to start. This can be
thought of more theoretically in terms of feedback -- that below a certain percentage of e.g.
African Americans, it becomes very hard to attract and maintain such employees. Thus, we
can add that in as a constraint.
